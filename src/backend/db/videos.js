    description: `Tom Felton became almost as popular as Daniel Radcliffe! Draco Malfoy became one of the beloved Harry Potter characters despite Joanne Rowling's wish. 

      Some think that directors don't want Tom Felton in their projects, but this is not true. The actor has acted in more than 15 films since the end of Harry Potter, portraying various characters.
